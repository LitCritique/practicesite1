<h1> Welcome to my portfolio </h1>

<p>
I just completed my 16th year in education. I've taught in public middle schools, charter high schools, and am currently teaching English 10 and AP Seminar English 10 at Colgan High School.

I started teaching middle school English to grades 6-8 Gifted in Winter Haven, Florida. After 8 years, I moved to a charter school in Lakeland and taught as the only 7th grade English teacher. Three years later, I moved to 9th grade English and 9th grade Adv. 
After Covid, my husband and I decided to pack up and move to Virginia. Now, I teach at a high school with a focus on fine arts and I couldn't be happier. </p>

I earned my BA in English and Secondary Education in 2007, my Master's in Educational Leadership in 2016, and I am currently working on a Master's in English Literature. >/p>
