I just completed my 16th year in education. I've taught in both public schools and charter schools, and I am currently teaching English 10 and AP Seminar English 10 at <a href "https://colganhs.pwcs.edu/"> Colgan High School </a>. 
</p> 

<p> 
I started teaching middle school English to grades 6-8 Gifted in Winter Haven, Florida. After 8 years, I moved to a charter school in Lakeland and taught 
as the only 7th grade English teacher. Three years later, I moved to 9th grade English and 9th grade Adv. 
After Covid, my husband and I decided to pack up and move to Virginia. 
Now, I teach at a high school with a focus on fine arts and I couldn't be happier. </p>

<p>
I earned my BA in English and Secondary Education in 2007, my Master's in Educational Leadership in 2016, and I am currently working on a Master's in English Literature. </p>
