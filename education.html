<h4> Overview</h4>
I attended Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida from 2003-2007. There, I pursued a double major in English and Secondary Education.

<h4> Academic Highlights</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>English Major:</strong> Focused on literary analysis, critical theory, and research. Dr. Buck, my advisor, encouraged me to explore my curiosities related to the connections between classic and contemporary literature.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secondary Education Major:</strong> Gained hands-on experiences in pedagogy, curriculum design, and classroom management. Interned at Lakeland High School for 2 semesters, one in a self-contained ESOL English class and the second in an AP Literature class. Dr. Watts taught me how to be the educator we all wish we had had when we needed it the most.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4> Skills Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
   Written and verbal communication 
  <li>
  Lesson planning and instructional design
  </li>
   <li>
 Critical analysis and critical thinking 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Lasting Legacy </h4>
The professors I had at Florida Southern, as well as the tight-knit cohort I learned with, really taught me to love learning and finding the secrets hidden in plain sight. This not only laid the foundation for my love of reading and writing, but helped me to understand, in my teaching profession, that learning has to be enjoyable before it can happen. If I can make learning fun and relevant, students will retain the information and, hopefully, learn to sate their curiosity themselves.
