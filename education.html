<h4> Overview</h4>
I attended Florida Southern College in Lakeland, Florida from 2003-2007. There, I pursued a double major in English and Secondary Education.
<h4> Academic Highlights</h4>

<ol> English Major: Focused on literary analysis, critical theory, and research. Dr. Buck, my advisor, encouraged me to explore my curiosities related to the connections between classic and contemporary literature.
     Secondary Education Major: Gained hands-on experiences in pedagogy, curriculum design, and classroom management. Interned at Lakeland High School for 2 semesters, one in a self-contained ESOL English class and the second in an AP Literature class. Dr. Watts taught me how to be the educator we all wish we had had when we needed it the most.
