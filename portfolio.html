<h1>Portfolio of Projects</h1>

<h2>Sway Independent Research Project</h2>
<h4>
  The goal of this project is to empower students to explore a topic of personal or academic interest through a multi-genre research approach. Rather than relying solely on traditional essays, students are encouraged to incorporate creative outlets—such as poetry, visual art, interviews, infographics, or multimedia presentations—to express their understanding and findings.</h4>

<b>This project is designed to:</b>

<ul>
  <li>
  Foster critical thinking by requiring students to evaluate sources for credibility and bias
  <li>
  Develop research skills through the use of citations, annotations, and synthesis of information
   <li>
  Encourage creativity by allowing students to choose how they present their research across multiple genres
 
   <li>
  Promote student voice by giving them ownership over both the topic and the format
  <li>
 Support peer learning by having students teach others about their topic through their final Sway presentation
     </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<b>Ultimately, this project blends academic rigor with creative expression, helping students become more thoughtful researchers, effective communicators, and engaged learners.</b>
